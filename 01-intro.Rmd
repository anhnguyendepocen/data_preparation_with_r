# Introduction {#intro}

Data is proliferating, collected from myriad events in our lives. Data about your day today might be collected when you 

* bought a cup of coffee (which generates at least three types of data: about the drink itself, about your coffee habits through the rewards program, and about the financial transaction); 

* travelled to your place of work or study, measured by the movement of your cell phone; 

* your fitness activities through your wearable tech; and

* watched a movie on a streaming service.

A lot has been written about the benefits of organizations being "data-driven", as better decisions can be made as a consequence of good data analysis. There is no limit to where data analysis is being applied; businesses can compete on analytics [@Davenport_Harris_2007] and public health strategies during a pandemic can be informed [@Polonsky_etal_2019].

The people who can extract insights from that the relevant data are very much in demand.

The process of going from raw data to decision support is often called data science. It combines the academic disciplines of statistics, computer programming, and the subject matter (be it astronomy, psychology, economics, or business). [@Conway_Venn_2010]

The typical data science process has been described in this model [@Wickham_Grolemund2016]:

Most data science and statistics text books use example data sets that are nicely formatted and easy to import.  Anscombe's Quartet [@Anscombe_1973] is a famous example of a small data set that was designed to produce specific statistical results. Other data sets might be chosen for their statistical properties, or compiled as a summary example. 

But in real life the data we find ourselves working with is, more often than not, entirely different from those text book examples. 

* The data we need might not exist yet, so we have to design our own data collection process.

* Data can be stored in different formats–spreadsheets, databases, software-specific file formats, websites, and PDF files. We need to have tools to access the data, no matter the file format.

* We might receive data from multiple sources, so we end up with two files that have what appears to be the same value coded in different ways. For example, my home province in Canada can be represented as "British Columbia", "B.C.", or "BC". And don't get me started on date formats—we'll save that for later.

* Data might have as-of-yet undetected errors. It might be incomplete, inconsistent, or it might have data entry errors.

* It might have bias. And there are many different types of bias.

* It might contain sensitive information, and our sharing of the data, including the publication of reports, needs to protect the individual records of the people or businesses that provided the information. For example, you might be working with health records or tax records. Any disclosure of an individual record might be considered a privacy breach...so you have to take great care to ensure that what you've published doesn't violate any legal, ethical, or moral frameworks.


This book will introduce steps to ensure that you can assemble your data in a way that allows you to undertake the rest of the data science process, including making data and analysis available for a wider audience. Much of what is required in these steps can be programmed in R, so that your efforts are reproducible. (For more about what is meant by "reproducibility", see  [@Gandrud_2015] and [@Smith_reproducible_2017].)
