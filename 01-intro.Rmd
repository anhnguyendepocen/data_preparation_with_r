# Introduction {#intro}


The typical data science process has been described in this model [@Wickham_Grolemund2016]:

Most data science and statistics text books use example data sets that are nicely formatted and easy to import.  Anscombe's Quartet [@Anscombe_1973] is a famous example of a small data set that was designed to produce the statistical results that are demonstrated. Other data sets might be chosen for their statistical properties, or compiled as a summary example. 

But in real life, the data we find is often entirely different from this.

* The data we need might not exist yet, so we have to design our own data collection process.

* Data can be stored in different formats–spreadsheets, databases, software-specific file formats, websites, and PDF files. We need to have tools to access the data, no matter the file format.

* We might receive data from multiple sources, so we end up with two files that have what appears to be the same value coded in different ways. For example, my home province in Canada can be represented as "British Columbia", "B.C.", or "BC". And don't get me started on date formats—we'll save that for later.

* Data might have as-of-yet undetected errors. It might be incomplete, inconsistent, or it might have data entry errors.

* It might have bias.

Thankfully, there are ways to ensure that you can assemble your data in a way that allows you to undertake the rest of the data science process. Much of what is required in these steps can be programmed in R, so that your efforts are reproducible. (For more about what is meant by "reproducibility", see  [@Gandrud_2015] and [@Smith_reproducible_2017].)
