_Draft_

It is routinely noted that the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) applies to data science—80% of one's time is spent on data collection and preparation, and the remaining 20% on the "fun stuff" like modeling, data visualization, and communication.

There is no shortage of material—text books, journal articles, blog posts, online courses, podcasts, etc.— about the 20%. This modest book hopes to serve as an introduction and wayfinder for readers seeking to understand core elements of the other 80%.

## You, the reader

It is assumed that the reader of this book will have a working knowledge of the fundamental data manipulation functions in R (whether base or tidyverse or packages beyond those), or another programming language. If you can filter for specific values in the variables and select the columns you want, know the difference between a character string and a numeric value (`"1"` or `1`), then we're on our way. 

If you don't possess that knowledge yet, I would recommend that you work through _R for Data Science_ by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund [@Wickham_Grolemund2016]. This book, freely avaible at [r4ds.had.co.nz](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), will give you a running start.
