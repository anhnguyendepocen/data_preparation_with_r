# A data collection example

Let's imagine that you are the data analyst for a store located near a university, so it only sells two products:

* boxes of mac & cheese

* ketchup

The store orders both products from a single wholesaler. The store keeps track of sales, store inventory, and orders using a relational database.

The store is a success, so there's a plan to open a second location. 

Your assignment is to project (forecast) the new store's sales using data from the first store. Some questions you'll need to answer are:

* How many customers does Store 1 serve? (That is, how big is the market?) How big is the area that Store 2 will serve?

* The marketing department has said that people with higher income will eat more mac & cheese, and also use a different variety of ketchupâ€”Dijon ketchup. How can you find out if Area 2 has people with a million dollars?

How do you know that it's a higher income area? How do you know you are selling more?
