## SQL

### First: how do you say "SQL"?

The backstory is that in the 1970s, IBM came out with "SEQUEL", which stood for "Structured English QUEry Language". So it was pronounced [ ˈsiːkwəl ].

But "SEQUEL" was already trademarked, so IBM shortened it to the TLA ^[Three Letter Abbreviation] "SQL", and the pronunciation remained. However, some folks say the names of the letters—[ ˈɛs kjuː ˈɛl ]

Either way, somebody is going to tell that you're saying it wrong. [@Thanh_2018]
