# Importing data {#importing}

Before we can start analyzing data—before we get to the "Import" step—we need to collect it. And we also need to thing about what data we want to collect. 

And "collecting data" can mean a lot of different things. It could refer to:

* Running trials or experiments in a controlled laboratory setting.

* Making observations and recording the results of those observations (for example, as an astronomer or biologist might).

* Sampling the people in an area and asking them a series of questions.

* Collecting information as part of a business operation. A familiar example are supermarket checkout scanners which data about grocery purchases, which facilitate operation management of the store by tracking sales and inventory, and generating orders.

* Downloading data from a website, where the downloaded table has data that has already been compiled and summarized from a larger data set. An example would be Statistics Canada's Census data tables.

And it's important to note that your analysis project might require more than one of these methods of data collection.

How you collect the data you need will depend on many factors, including what is already available, what your budget is (some data collection methods will cost a lot more than others), and the legal and regulatory environment (for example, the definition of "personal information" varies from one jurisdiction to the next.
