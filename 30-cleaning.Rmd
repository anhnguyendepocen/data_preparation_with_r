# Cleaning data

Some _significant_ applications are demonstrated in this chapter.


What are common dirty data problems?

* Column headers are values, not variable names

* Changing type of data

* Multiple variables are stored in one column

* Misspellings (typing errors)

* Value in wrong field (e.g. country entered into `city` field)

* Irregularities (`salary` field in international survey, filled in as Canadian, U.S., and Australian dollars)

* Contradiction (for example, two databases with the same person but the date of birth differs, perhaps due to non-ISO8601 entry: 07-08-79 and 08-07-79 both have the same digits but one could be mm-dd-yy and the other dd-mm-yy...we just don't know which is the correct one. Or is one a typo?)

Detection and localization of errors like:

* Missing values and imputation

* Special values

* Outliers

* Duplicates
