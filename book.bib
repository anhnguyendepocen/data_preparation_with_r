Abstract = {Rationale and objectives The availability of anonymized data is a keystone of medical research, yet little is known about lay views towards the process of anonymization or on the way that anonymized medical data are transferred to researchers. Methods During May and June 2009, as part of a wider consultation on methods for releasing data to researchers, three focus groups ( n = 19) were conducted exploring lay attitudes towards the traditional 'warehouse' model commonly used in medical research for delivering anonymized National Health Service (NHS) data to researchers. The focus groups explored different processes such as the copying of data, use of programmers for linkage and anonymization, the transfer of data and governance. Results The recognition of the positive aspects of medical research and desire to support it formed the context for discussions. Nonetheless, individuals varied in their attitudes to the use of anonymized data extracts for research from their health records},

abstract = {We distinguish diagrammatic from sentential paper-and-pencil representations of information by developing alternative models of information-processing systems that are informationally equivalent and that can be characterized as sentential or diagrammatic. Sentential representations are sequential, like the propositions in a text. Diagrammatic representations are indexed by location in a plane. Diagrammatic representations also typically display information that is only implicit in sentential representations and that therefore has to be computed, sometimes at great cost, to make it explicit for use. We then contrast the computational efficiency of these representations for solving several illustrative problems in mathematics and physics. When two representations are informationally equivalent, their computational efficiency depends on the information-processing operators that act on them. Two sets of operators may differ in their capabilities for recognizing patterns, in the inferences they can carry out directly, and in their control strategies (in particular, the control of search). Diagrammatic and sentential representations support operators that differ in all of these respects. Operators working on one representation may recognize features readily or make inferences directly that are difficult to realize in the other representation. Most important, however, are differences in the efficiency of search for information and in the explicitness of information. In the representations we call diagrammatic, information is organized by location, and often much of the information needed to make an inference is present and explicit at a single location. In addition, cues to the next logical step in the problem may be present at an adjacent location. Therefore problem solving can proceed through a smooth traversal of the diagram, and may require very little search or computation of elements that had been implicit.},

    abstract = { Health information technology has increased accessibility of health and medical data and benefited medical research and healthcare management. However, there are rising concerns about patient privacy in sharing medical and healthcare data. A large amount of these data are in free text form. Existing techniques for privacy-preserving data sharing deal largely with structured data. Current privacy approaches for medical text data focus on detection and removal of patient identifiers from the data, which may be inadequate for protecting privacy or preserving data quality. We propose a new systematic approach to extract, cluster, and anonymize medical text records. Our approach integrates methods developed in both data privacy and health informatics fields. The key novel elements of our approach include a recursive partitioning method to cluster medical text records based on the similarity of the health and medical information and a value-enumeration method to anonymize potentially identifying information in the text data. An experimental study is conducted using real-world medical documents. The results of the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. }

 abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide a critical review of the main advances in small area estimation (SAE) methods in recent years. We also discuss some of the earlier developments, which serve as a necessary background for the new studies. The review focuses on model dependent methods with special emphasis on point prediction of the target area quantities, and mean square error assessments. The new models considered are models used for discrete measurements, time series models and models that arise under informative sampling. The possible gains from modeling the correlations among small area random effects used to represent the unexplained variation of the small area target quantities are examined. For review and appraisal of the earlier methods used for SAE, see Ghosh & Rao (1994). /// Cette communication a pour but de fournir une revue des principaux développements des méthodes d'estimation pour les statistiques des petites régions, des années récentes. Nous discutons également des développements précédents, qui serviront d'arrière-plan pour les études nouvelles. La revue se concentre sur les méthodes basées sur les modèles et met le point surtout sur la prédiction ponctuelle des quantités des petites régions et l'estimation des erreurs carrées moyennes. Les nouveaux modèles considérés sont des modèles employés pour les mesures discrètes, des modèles de séries temporelles et des modèles produits sous l'échantillonnage informatif. On examine aussi les bénéfices possibles de l'emploi des modèles pour décrire les corrélations entre les effets aléatoires des petites régions, afin de représenter la variation inexpliquée entre ces quantités. Une revue et une évaluation des méthodes employées antérieurement pour les statistiques des petites régions sont présentées par Ghosh & Rao (1994).},
